## Security Fixes

### 1. Fix GitHub Workflow File with SSH Keys

**What to do:** Replace the password-based authentication with SSH key authentication.

**Steps:**
1. First, generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one:
   - Open your terminal/command prompt
   - Run: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deployment-key"`
   - Save the key to a secure location (default is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
   - This creates a private key and a public key (`id_ed25519.pub`)

2. Add the public key to your server:
   - Copy the content of your public key file (`id_ed25519.pub`)
   - SSH into your server using your existing credentials
   - Add the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:
     ```
     echo "your-public-key-content-here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

3. Update the GitHub workflow file:
   - Navigate to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Replace the existing content with the updated secure workflow

4. Add the private key as a GitHub secret:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Value: The entire content of your private key file (including begin/end lines)
   - Add two more secrets:
     - `SERVER_HOST`: Your server hostname or IP (e.g., `107.174.102.231`)
     - `SERVER_USER`: Your server username (e.g., `damned`)

### 2. Secure the Payment Processing API

**What to do:** Enhance the payment processing API with more secure practices.

   - Replace with the enhanced version that includes:
     - Rate limiting
     - Input sanitization
     - Proper error handling
     - Secure logging (no sensitive data)

4. Update environment variables:
   - Add the following to your `.env` file:
     ```
     ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-random-key-here
     API_RATE_LIMIT=10
     ```
